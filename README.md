# Linguess

Linguess is a Flutter-based multilingual word puzzle application.  
Players guess words in a **target language** based on their equivalents in another language.  
The app includes daily challenges, category-based games, hints, progress tracking, and a gold-based in-app economy.  
User authentication and data persistence are managed via Firebase.
